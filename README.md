## ✨ Overview  

**Multhetizer** is a playful experiment mixing **distributed systems** concepts with a **musical instrument** idea.  
Instead of resonating through pipes and air like a real organ, this instrument will "resonate" across **multiple computers** on a network.  

Think of it as a *distributed pipe organ* — but for informatics labs. 🎶💻

## 🎯 Motivation  

At the start of the semester, I’ll be diving into a **Distributed Systems** course.  
This project is a way to:  

- 📚 Explore distributed system methods in practice.  
- 🎵 Combine programming with music (and a silly idea).  
- 🤝 Create a fun "organ" that plays across machines in a lab.  



## 🛠️ Features (planned / in progress)  

- 🎼 Send musical notes across clients.  
- 🖥️ Multiple machines act as "organ pipes."  
- 🔗 Experiment with different distributed techniques.  
- 🔊 Eventually: turn visualized notes into actual sound.  



## 📸 Concept  

> Imagine a lab full of computers where each screen lights up and "plays a note" —  
> together, forming an **organ of machines**.
